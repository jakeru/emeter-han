#+TITLE: ESP32 Electricity meter MQTT

Written by Jakob Ruhe (jakob.ruhe@gmail.com) April 2021.

* Introduction
This application collects data from an electricity meter and forwards it to a
MQTT server. The HAN port is used to get the data out from the Electricity
meter. It is available on all meters installed in Sweden after around year 2020
or so.

Note that you may need to contact the company that delivers the electricity to
your home and tell them to activate the HAN port in your electricity meter. For
Ellevio that can be done through [[https://ellevio.se/privat][My pages at Ellevio]].

This application is inspired by the web site [[https://www.hanporten.se][HANporten.se]] which contains more
information about the HAN port and the protocol.

* Hardware
** Needed hardware
- A RJ12 cable to connect to the HAN port of your electricity meter. You will
  need to cut it to the length you want and be able to connect the wires to your
  board. Note that some wires are crossed and some are not!
- An ESP32 or ESP8266 board. I have tested the software with a
  [[https://www.adafruit.com/product/3405][Adafruit HUZZAH32 â€“ ESP32 Feather Board]] but basically any board should work
  by modifying the =platform.ini= and =src/config.h= files a bit.
- A resistor of something between 1k and 10k ohm to pull up the data signal to 3.3 V.

** How to connect it
- Connect =VCC= (Pin 1) and =DATA REQUEST= (Pin 2) of the HAN port in order for
  the meter to actually send data.
- Connect =DATA GND= (Pin 3) of the HAN port to the ground pin of your board.
- Connect =DATA OUT= (Pin 5) of the HAN port to the =CONF_PIN_DATA_RX= (set in
  =config.h=) pin of your board. Make sure to choose a pin that can act as a
  digital input pin.
- Connect =CONF_PIN_DATA_RX= pin on your board to the =3.3 V= pin of your board
  using a 1k to 10k ohm resistor. This must be done because the =DATA_REQUEST=
  pin is of open collector type. In addition to this, it is also inverted, so it
  is normally low. Low (close to 0 V) translates to a logical =1= and high
  (close to 3.3 V) is a logical =0=.

See [[see][HANporten - Svenska porten]] for more details about the pins of the HAN port.

** Power your board
The =VCC= pin of the HAN port is at 5 V and is able to deliver 250 mA. That is
probably enough to power your board. But note that you should not power your
board from the electricity meter while the board is also getting power from its
USB port. Note that not all electricity meters supply a 5 V at the =VCC= pin.

* Software
** Dependencies
*** Toolchain
This project requires [[https://platformio.org][PlatformIO]] and its Core (CLI) package. Installation
instructions about how to install it can be found here:
[[https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/core/installation.html#installation-methods][Install PlatformIO Core (CLI)]].

*** MQTT server
You also need an MQTT server. Either you run it locally in your home on a
Raspberry Pi or similar, or you can choose to run it on a server on the
Internet.

This is the server I run on my Raspberry Pi 4 at home:
[[https://mosquitto.org][Eclipse Mosquitto - An open source MQTT broker]].

If you want a cloud based solution the first two hits on Google will probably
work fine as well:
- [[https://www.cloudmqtt.com][CloudMQTT - Hosted message broker for the
  Internet of Things]]
- [[https://www.hivemq.com][HiveMQ Cloud - Free Fully Managed MQTT Platform]]

** Test on host
#+begin_src bash
pio test
#+end_src

** Configure
Open the file =src/config.h= and set:
- SSID and passphrase needed to access your WiFi.
- Address and port of the MQTT server.
- MQTT account settings.
- Set the MQTT base topic if you have multiple electricity meters in your home
  or if you prefer another name.
- Set the pins to use for the LEDs (it depends on your board).
- Set the pin (=CONF_PIN_DATA_RX=) that you have connected to the DATA pin of
  the HAN port.

** Build for target
Two targets are supported. One ESP32:
#+begin_src bash
pio run -e huzzah32
#+end_src
And one based on ESP8266:
#+begin_src bash
pio run -e esp12
#+end_src

** Upload
Configure the file =platformio.ini= to use the right serial port. Then flash the
MCU like this:
#+begin_src bash
pio run -e huzzah32 --target upload
#+end_src

Read the data from the serial port and make sure the board connects
successfully to your WiFi and to your MQTT server. With Python it can be done
like this:
#+begin_src bash
python -m serial /dev/ttyUSB0 115200
#+end_src

When the board is connected to your WiFi you can upgrade the software over the
air. See =platform.ini= for instructions.
